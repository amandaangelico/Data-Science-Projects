# Data Science Projects by Amanda Angelico

Welcome to my collection of data science projects! My interests in data science are broad, but I've primarily focused on developing recommendation systems as shown below. Each project showcases a unique application of machine learning and data analysis techniques. I encourage you to explore these projects to understand the datasets, analysis methods and insights gathered. This portfolio will be continuously updated with both academic assignments and personal endeavors.

## Featured Projects

- [Music Recommendation System](./Music-Recommendation-System/README.md): A project aimed at enhancing music discovery experiences on platforms like Spotify through tailored song recommendations.
- [Product Recommendation System](./Product-Recommendation-System/README.md): An exploration into offering personalized product suggestions to improve the online shopping experience.

I hope you find these projects insightful and indicative of my passion for data science and machine learning. Your feedback and inquiries are always welcome.
